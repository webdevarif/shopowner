                <p class="text-[32px] font-medium mb-5">Our story starts in Bruges in 1963, where Georges Leman, former student at ‘Ter Groene Poorte’, worked in a small bakery where he began to craft his talents.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">Each Sunday, Georges’ small bakery made beautiful marzipan roses ready for the following week. Georges poured his heart and soul into perfecting each petal. It was an act of love that became the birthplace of a brilliant idea... what if he could share his exquisite creations with professional bakers across the land? Leman Decorations was born.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">Today, Leman Decorations stands tall as one of the world’s most innovative creators of edible and non-edible decorations, with state-of-the-art facilities in Belgium, Thailand and Mauritius.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">Serving 55 countries, with an extensive range of products, growth and success can be attributed to the collective passion and expertise of its 450 talented employees, who tirelessly elevate and add value to their customers’ creations.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">In 2021, Leman Decorations joined forces with the world-renowned Cargill family. This union serves to further extend the company’s reach and impact.</p>
                <p class="text-[20px]">With both headquarters based in Mouscron, Belgium, with incredible state-of-the-art facilities; our customers witness extraordinary demonstrations, forge impactful partnerships, and create ground-breaking innovations.</p>

                    <p class="text-[20px] mb-4">To compete and justify a fair markup, artisans and culinary professionals must differentiate their offer and upgrade their customers’ experience.</p>
